# (Front End) Slider
The main purpose of this practice was to learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JS to build slider functionality, which can be used in my future projects. 
Some of the gained skills are: 
* The basic structure of HTML
* CSS features like flexbox, grid, gradient, position, linear-gradient
* JS basic syntax and use of DOM (get the element from HTML, and store it in a parameter to manipulate)
* Also practiced organizing elements in different display sizes such as in mobil devices and giving the option to be re-organized when loaded in the mobile devices.
